> What to do after getting reverse shells
---



## Spawn an partially interactive shell

Linux:
```python
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

> Press ctrl + Z to put the reverse shell session on background and execute the following command on your local terminal.

```shell
stty raw -echo
```

> Once done, run the *fg* command to bring forth the reverse shell on the background. Usually this will get you a broken shell.

```shell
export TERM=xterm
```

> Finally export xterm on the session and will give a full-fledged interactive shell.
